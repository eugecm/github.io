	<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of switching to <a href="https://octopus.energy/agile/">Agile
Octopus</a>, an electricity tariff that ties the
price I pay with the wholesale price, updated every 30 minutes. The reason I&rsquo;ve
been looking forward to switching to a tariff as dynamic as this one is to
restrict my electric boiler to only run during the cheapest times of the day.</p>
<p>My boiler is a <em>direct unvented cylinder</em>. In Layman&rsquo;s terms this is a big
cyclinder that heats and stores water. In a perfect world all the water stored
in the heater would not lose any heat over time when hot water is not being
used, but this is a pretty old boiler so it&rsquo;s not really efficient. Leaving it
&ldquo;on&rdquo; the whole day can actually use a lot of energy as it tries to compensate
for loss of heat at random times.</p>
<p>I got a smart meter installed at the beginning of March (a prerequisite for
getting Agile). This also lets me track my usage on a half-hourly basis. I
decided to run a few experiments with the boiler: switching it off for some
24-hour periods, switching it on only during a 2-hour window, moving the window
around etc. This was mostly to get a sense of how much power it needs on a daily
basis.</p>
<p>My guesstimate is that the boiler needs to run for about 2 hours at 3kW. My
daily consumption is about 13kWh, so the boiler accounts for almost half of that
(2h * 3kW = 6kWh).</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.energy-stats.uk/download-historical-pricing-data/">a
website</a> where I
can download the historical pricing data for Agile in London. It&rsquo;s basically a
CSV file with the 30 minute window of the day and the price (pence per kW) for
that window. The data looks like this:</p>

</code></pre><p>The question I need to answer is simple: What&rsquo;s, on average, the cheapest 2-hour
window?</p>
<p>It would be fairly straightforward to write a small program to calculte this,
but I wondered if there was a simple way to do it without writing any code.
Surely a spreadsheet could calculate it (somehow) but I was thinking I could
probably do this with command-line tools only.</p>
<p>I decided to try solving this using SQLite. This was my first time using it so
it took me a while to read through <a href="https://sqlite.org/docs.html">the
documentation</a>. Granted I could have finished
earlier had I written a small Python script but I figured I only had to pay for
this overhead once, and who knows, maybe knowing how to process CSV files in
SQLite may turn useful in the future.</p>
<p>The <code>sqlite3</code> command-line program is easy to use and can automatically ingest
CSV files into a table. The schema is determined from the header of the CSV
file, which I had to add manually but no big deal.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; .mode csv
sqlite&gt; .import csv_agile_C_London.csv agile
sqlite&gt; .schema agile
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS &quot;agile&quot;(
  &quot;time_utc&quot; TEXT,
  &quot;time_london&quot; TEXT,
  &quot;area_code&quot; TEXT,
  &quot;area_name&quot; TEXT,
  &quot;unit_price&quot; TEXT
);
</code></pre><p>Magic.</p>
<p>Now the query. Let&rsquo;s get the average price per 30-minute window for 6 months and
store it in a view.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE VIEW avg_by_period AS SELECT TIME(time_utc) slot, AVG(unit_price) price FROM agile WHERE time_utc BETWEEN &quot;2020-10-01&quot; AND &quot;2021-03-01&quot; GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 ASC;

</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m using <em>IN</em> and not <em>BETWEEN</em> so that the query works for the periods between
22:30 and 23:30, as the offset makes the time wrap around the day.</p>
<p>It looks like the cheapest 2-hour window is the one that starts at <strong>3:00</strong>.</p>
<p>I will probably set the boiler to run at <strong>4:00</strong> instead, as the difference is
not great and it brings it closer to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; hours, when I&rsquo;ll be using hot water.</p>
<p>SQLite was fun to use, I&rsquo;m impressed by how quickly you can get queryable data
from CSV files.</p>
